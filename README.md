# Cursor Rules Project

This project is a personal collection of rules for using Cursor, divided into two categories:

1. **Global Rules (`.md` files)**: These are general guidelines applicable across all projects.
2. **Project Rules (`.mdc` files)**: These are specific to individual projects and may override or supplement global rules.
